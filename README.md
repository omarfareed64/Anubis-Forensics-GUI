### Adding New Pages

1. **Create the page class**
   ```python
   from pages.base_page import BasePage
   from PyQt5.QtCore import pyqtSignal
   
   class NewPage(BasePage):
       # Define signals for navigation
       next_page_requested = pyqtSignal()
       
       def __init__(self):
           super().__init__()
           self.setup_page_content()
       
       def setup_page_content(self):
           # Add your UI elements here
           pass
   ```

2. **Register in MainWindow**
   ```python
   # In main_window.py
   self.new_page = NewPage()
   self.stacked_widget.addWidget(self.new_page)
   
   # Connect signals
   self.new_page.next_page_requested.connect(self._show_next_page)
   ```

### Styling Guidelines

The application uses consistent styling:

```python
# Colors (defined in base_page.py)
COLOR_ORANGE = "#F57C1F"
COLOR_DARK = "#23292f"
COLOR_GRAY = "#e5e5e5"

# Fonts
FONT_TITLE = QFont("Cascadia Mono", 22, QFont.Weight.Bold)
FONT_TAB = QFont("Archivo", 16, QFont.Weight.Bold)

# Common styling methods
self.create_styled_input(placeholder="Enter text")
self.create_styled_button("Click Me", callback=self.handle_click)
```

## 📊 Logging

### Logging Configuration

```python
from utils.logger import get_logger, log_exceptions

# Get logger
logger = get_logger("my_module")

# Log messages
logger.info("Operation completed successfully")
logger.warning("Something to watch out for")
logger.error("An error occurred", exc_info=True)

# Decorator for automatic exception logging
@log_exceptions("my_module")
def risky_function():
    # This function's exceptions will be automatically logged
    pass
```

- **Type Safety**: Type hints throughout codebase for maintainability
- **Async Support**: Asynchronous programming for non-blocking operations

#### **Key Design Patterns**

**Model-View-Controller (MVC) Architecture**:
```python
# Model: Data representation
class Case:
    def __init__(self, number: str, name: str, description: str):
        self.number = number
        self.name = name
        self.description = description

# View: UI components
class CaseCreationPage(BasePage):
    def setup_ui(self):
        self.case_number_input = self.create_styled_input("Case Number")
        self.case_name_input = self.create_styled_input("Case Name")

# Controller: Business logic
class CaseService:
    async def create_case(self, case_data: dict) -> Case:
        # Business logic implementation
        pass
```

**Service Layer Pattern**:
```python
class APIClient:
    def __init__(self, base_url: str, api_key: str):
        self.base_url = base_url
        self.api_key = api_key
    
    async def create_case(self, case_data: dict) -> APIResponse:
        # API communication logic
        pass
```

**Factory Pattern for Evidence Types**:
```python
class EvidenceFactory:
    @staticmethod
    def create_evidence(evidence_type: str, **kwargs) -> Evidence:
        if evidence_type == "memory":
            return MemoryEvidence(**kwargs)
        elif evidence_type == "file":
            return FileEvidence(**kwargs)
        # Additional evidence types
```

#### **Critical Code Components**

**1. Remote Acquisition Engine**:
```python
class RemoteAcquisitionService:
    async def establish_connection(self, target_ip: str, credentials: dict) -> bool:
        """Establish secure remote connection using PSTools"""
        try:
            # PsExec connection logic
            command = f'psexec \\\\{target_ip} -u {credentials["username"]} -p {credentials["password"]} cmd'
            # Implementation details
            return True

#### **Detailed Analysis Options Explanations**

**1. Memory Analysis (RAM Forensics)**

**What is Memory Analysis?**
Memory analysis, also known as RAM forensics or volatile memory forensics, involves the examination of a computer's random access memory (RAM) to extract digital evidence that exists only in volatile memory and is lost when the system is powered off.

**Why is Memory Analysis Important?**
- **Volatile Evidence**: Captures evidence that disappears when the system is shut down
- **Running Processes**: Reveals currently running applications and their states
- **Network Connections**: Shows active network connections and communication
- **Encrypted Data**: May contain decrypted data that was encrypted on disk
- **Malware Detection**: Identifies malicious processes and injected code
- **User Activity**: Captures user sessions, passwords, and recent activities

**How Memory Analysis Works:**
1. **Memory Acquisition**: Using tools like WinPmem to create a memory dump
2. **Profile Detection**: Identifying the operating system version and architecture
3. **Process Analysis**: Extracting running processes, their memory maps, and loaded modules
4. **Network Analysis**: Identifying active network connections and listening ports
5. **String Extraction**: Searching for meaningful text strings in memory
6. **Artifact Recovery**: Extracting files, registry hives, and other artifacts from memory

**Key Artifacts Revealed:**
- **Running Processes**: List of all active processes with PIDs and memory addresses
- **Network Connections**: Active TCP/UDP connections and associated processes
- **Loaded DLLs**: Dynamic link libraries loaded by processes
- **Command History**: Recently executed commands and command line arguments
- **Encryption Keys**: Cryptographic keys and certificates in memory
- **Browser Data**: Passwords, cookies, and session data from web browsers
- **Malware Artifacts**: Suspicious processes, injected code, and rootkits

**Forensic Value:**
Memory analysis provides a "snapshot" of system activity at the time of acquisition, revealing what was happening on the system when the memory dump was taken. This is crucial for incident response, malware analysis, and understanding user behavior patterns.

---

**2. Web Artifact Analysis (Browser Forensics)**

**What is Web Artifact Analysis?**
Web artifact analysis involves the examination of web browser data to reconstruct a user's online activities, including browsing history, downloads, bookmarks, cookies, and other web-related artifacts stored by browsers.

**Why is Web Artifact Analysis Important?**
- **User Behavior**: Reveals user's online activities and interests
- **Timeline Reconstruction**: Provides chronological evidence of web browsing
- **Evidence Preservation**: Captures web-based evidence that may be deleted from servers
- **Authentication Data**: Contains login credentials and session information
- **Download History**: Shows files downloaded and their sources
- **Search Queries**: Reveals search terms and visited websites

**How Web Artifact Analysis Works:**
1. **Browser Identification**: Locating browser profile directories
2. **Database Extraction**: Accessing browser databases (SQLite files)
3. **History Analysis**: Parsing browsing history and download records
4. **Cookie Examination**: Extracting authentication and tracking cookies
5. **Bookmark Analysis**: Recovering saved bookmarks and favorites
6. **Cache Analysis**: Examining cached web pages and resources
7. **Form Data**: Extracting saved form data and autofill information

**Key Artifacts Revealed:**
- **Browsing History**: URLs visited, page titles, and timestamps
- **Download Records**: Files downloaded, sources, and completion times
- **Cookies**: Authentication tokens, session data, and tracking information
- **Bookmarks**: Saved websites and folder structures
- **Search Queries**: Terms searched in various search engines
- **Login Credentials**: Saved usernames and encrypted passwords
- **Form Data**: Auto-filled information and saved form entries
- **Cache Files**: Cached web pages, images, and other resources

**Forensic Value:**
Web artifacts provide a comprehensive picture of a user's online activities, including websites visited, searches performed, files downloaded, and authentication patterns.
